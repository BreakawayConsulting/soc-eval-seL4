# SoC Evaluations for seL4

Finding a suitable system-on-chip (SoC) for an seL4 project can be difficult.

This set of documents describes and evaluates different SoC-s with respect to their suitability for running seL4.

These evaluations are performed on an ad-hoc basis, and may be performed either with access to only the documentation, or with hands-on experience of the SoC.
